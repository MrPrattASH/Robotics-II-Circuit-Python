# MONO OLED 128x64 i2C tutorial

This tutorial was originaly taken from ADAFruit [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/circuitpython-setup) and has since been modified to include documentation for only the Metro M4 Express board.

## Installing Libraries

Before beginning, you will need 3 relevant libraries that will do a lot of the heavy lifting for us. Install these to your M4 lib folder They are located in the folders/files above. If you be sure to download the entire folder contents for the bottom 2, not just the .mpy files. (unsure how to download files from GitHub? See [these instructions](https://www.itprotoday.com/development-techniques-and-management/how-do-i-download-files-github)):
* adafruit_displayio_ssd1306 (single mpy file)
* adafruit_bus_device (folder)
* adafruit_display_text (folder)
