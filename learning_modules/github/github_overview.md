# Using Github in Robotics

We'll use Github every class in this course for a few purposes:
1. It is an online backup of our work so we never lose any days of programming, designing, etc. Think of it like *Google Drive* but for code. 
2. It is a way of keeping track of our file changes over time, so we can "go back in time" to see what we've done, as well as restore any files we may have deleted by accident. 
    For example, you're writing code for anm autonomous rover, and your driving code work perfectly. 
    You then, in an hour programming session, make a new feature, a distance sensor, but this breaks your driving code so it no longer work properly. Now, we can simply "revert" back to the version of the code prior to when you made this new feature, saving past work. 
3. Github is an industry standard tool, so it is important to know how to use technology that real robotics engineers use every day.
