# Advanced Button Practice

Let's get more practice initializing pins for different components on our board. To do so, we'll make a more complex circuit. 

## Challenge 1
Wire up x2 buttons and x2 LEDs. Make each button toggle each LED individually. 

## Challenge 2
Wire up x1 buttons and x2 LEDs. Make this single button toggle 1 LED on, and the other LED off. When pressed, the LEDs swap their current states. 

## Challenge 3
Wire up x3 LEDs and x1 Button. Make this button:

1. LED 1: On / LED 2/3: Off
2. LED 2: On / LED 1/3: Off
3. LED 3: On / LED 1/2: Off 

## Challenge 4
Design your own circuit with LEDs
