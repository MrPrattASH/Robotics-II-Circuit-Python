# Libraries

Did someone accidently delete your lib folder on your M4? download the "lib" folder above, and add this to your M4 board for all our commonly used libraries in this course. 

Alternatively, the ada-fruit bundle is located above, where you may source the library needed for your project from a version of CircuitPython compatible with our boards
