# Mini Rosalind Franklin Mars Rover Project Flow (3D Printed, Technic Compatible)

Create a modified [Rosalind Franklin Rover](https://exploration.esa.int/web/mars/-/45084-exomars-rover), the rover European Space Agency (ESA) will be launching into space come 2028, to explore the surface of Mars. 

Your rover will be driving on a 2x3m scale model of the surface of Mars (Modeled after ESAâ€™s ESTEC campus Mars clean room.)

You will have a list of tasks to complete, similar to the science experiments required by the Rosalind Franklin when it is on the surface of mars.

Your rover will be based on the [ExoMy](https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki) RaspberryPi rover, modified to make the project simpler with less motors, simpler code, and able to be run with a circuit python board.
